Throughout these notes we have seen many examples of programming statements and expressions, but these are not from a real programming language. They are similar to parts of existing languages, but they're made up so as to have fundamental examples specifically for these notes.

When we're starting to design a solution to a problem, writing in a 'sort-of' programming language can be a very helpful thing to do. This 'sort-of' code, or **pseudocode** can be something that is very like plain english, or it can be somewhere near a high-level programming language. If we are designing an algorithm we can start by writing in pseudocode and we then don't need to worry about the implementation details of a particular programming language and can instead focus on the general problem solution, and the common programming structures that will help us to create our solution. By doing this the actual notation of a specific programming language does not hinder us. Once we have an initital solution (or part of one) written in pseudocode we can iterate over this design, moving it closer and closer to real code each time, until we have completed our implementation.

Writing pseudocode as a part of our design is one of the most powerful tools we have to help us with problem solving and creating algorithmic solutions. Whenever you need to start to write some code to create a program, start in pseudocode rather than real code, it will be a huge benefit to the final result.
