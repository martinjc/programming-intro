                    "feedback": "Yes, correct! A variable can store a single thing at any one time. That 'thing' may be a complex item made up of other things, but it is still only one single thing as far as the variable is concerned."
                },

                    "correct": "false",
                    "feedback": "No, sorry, that's incorrect. A variable does not store exactly 10 things at a time. Computers rarely deal with things in lots of ten as they tend to work in binary rather than decimal. 8, 64, or other values that are a power of 2 are more common to see as answers"

                    "feedback": "No, sorry, that's incorrect. Each data item we store in a variable takes up an amount of the computers available memory. To store an infinite number of values in a variable we would need a computer with infinite memory. This does not currently exist."

                    "feedback": "No, sorry, not in general. Although some programming languages may store expressions in variables, in most the expression is evaluated and then it is the result of the expression that is stored."

                    "feedback": "Yes, correct, well done! The expression will be evaluated and the result stored in the variable. The variable will have no memory or awareness of the expression itself."
