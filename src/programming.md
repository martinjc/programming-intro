# Programming

Programming is the task of writing a set of **clear instructions** to make a computer **perform some task**.

We usually write these instructions in a programming language (or code). In 'high-level' programming languages this code may be quite similar to written English. In 'low-level' languages this code may be quite strange and alien, and different from a language that we can read in a straighforward manner.

Programming languages (or code) are usually compiled to a low level language that the computer can understand, or to an intermediate language that is interpreted by some other program.

It is important when we write code that we make the instructions as clear as possible. Despite their sophistication and shinyness, and even with over 75 years of programming as a field[^1], Computers really are not clever.

To write clear instructions, we need to understand the fundamentals of programming - what we can do with code, how we can do it, and why we would do it that way. 

## Learning to Program

Before we start learning how to code, let's talk about the _process of learning to code_. Some people will find this very easy. Some will find it very hard. Your experience of this may be somewhere in the middle. 

If you'll permit me a short diversion into educational theory, it might help if we discuss the idea of a 'Threshold concept'. As with all things academic there is still some debate about the nature of these concepts, but in general they are ideas that tend to be:

-   Troublesome - they can be hard to understand or make sense of
-   Counterintuitive - they can run contrary to your current understanding
-   Integrative - they can reveal links between other concepts and ideas, and may not make sense without those links
-   Transformative - they open up new realms of knowledge once they are understood
-   Irreversible - once you grasp these concepts you are unlikely to forget them or go back to a previous level of understanding

The field of programming is littered with ideas and concepts that fit the definition of 'threshold concepts'. This means that there may be many ideas that you come across while learning to program that you may struggle to get to grips with. I tell you this not in an effort to put you off, but to make you aware of this fact, so that if you are not finding things easy you

[^1]: [ENIAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC), the first digital, general purpose, programmable, computer was completed in 1945, though there's an argument for [Colossus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossus_computer), which was earlier, though this was not [Turing complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness). You could even argue the field goes back to [Ada Lovelace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace) and her work with [Charles Babbage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage)'s proposed [Analytical Engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_Engine). We've been at this a while and it should probably be easier than this by now.
