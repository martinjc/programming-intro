# The course

This course is intended as a brief introduction to the subject of programming for people who have never programmed before. It consists of this set of notes, some videos which repeat and elaborate upon this set of notes, and some paper-based exercises designed to allow groups of students to work within structured guided lessons to solve fundamental programming problems without needing to learn a specific programming language.

# The notes

These notes are written in markdown and built using [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/). All notes are checked[^1] by [Proselint](proselint.com) and [Alex](https://github.com/get-alex/alex) for readability and inclusivity. This might not catch everything - if you see something that you think needs changing, please [let us know](https://github.com/martinjc/programming-intro/issues)!
